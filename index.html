    <h2>About Pat's Salmon Cookies</h2>
    <p>They're cookies made into the shape of a salmon, and actually made with salmon (though the fish is ground up so fine that you can't even taste it!) that is the ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a gray Seattle morning. Or gray Seattle afternoon... whatever. Tourists will go gaga for them, while locals will begrudgingly fall in love with them.</p>
